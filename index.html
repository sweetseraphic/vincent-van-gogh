    <h2>vinsent van gogh biography</h2>
    <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings,
        most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations
        of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty. Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often
        neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including
        a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself
        in the chest with a Lefaucheux revolver.He died from his injuries two days later. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh">learn more</a></p>

    <h2>quotes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>“It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.”</li>
        <li>“I dream my painting and I paint my dream.”</li>
        <li>“Be clearly aware of the stars and infinity on high. Then life seems almost enchanted after all.”</li>
        <li>“If you hear a voice within you say you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.”</li>
        <li>“What am I in the eyes of most people — a nonentity, an eccentric, or an unpleasant person — somebody who has no position in society and will never have; in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then — even if that were absolutely true, then
            I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love in spite of everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than on passion. Though
            I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum.”</li>
        <li>“I try more and more to be myself, caring relatively little whether people approve or disapprove.”</li>
